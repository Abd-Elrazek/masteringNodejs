/* Now we're gonna create a service to stream PNG's to a client. We will create
PNG data streams by piping the output stram of a conversion by ImageMagick, which
is executing as a separate process into the response stream of an HTTP connection, 
in which a converter is translating SVG data being generated in a virtual DOM that
exists in the Node runtime. Wow.


Full code not available right now
